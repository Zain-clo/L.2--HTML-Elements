    <h1>The Concord School</h1>
    <p>The Concord School, situated at <em> 1, Olubadan Avenue, Ring Road, Ibadan,</em> was founded in the year 2000. The mission of the school is to provide quality education for children between the age 15 months and 17 years through objectively planned nursery, primary and secondary education. The schoolâ€™s objective approach to education led to instant recognition by the relevant authorities and stakeholders in education in Nigeria and beyond.

 

       <mark>For more than a decade, the school has been consistent in her pursuit of excellence in offering the salient instructions that meet the needs of every child, based on her principle that no child should be left behind whenever and wherever learning takes place. The progress consequently recorded is attested to by numerous feats achieved thus far. </mark>
        
         
        
        Over the years, <strong>our curriculum has evolved to accommodate programmes that meet global requirement.</strong> The school presently prepares students for Cambridge International Examinations at various levels and the Senior School Certificate Examination.
        
         
        
        We are <s>poised</s> for greater heights as we continue in our bid to nurture young minds into individuals that will impact positively upon our world.
